# Sentence Analysis Algorithm

This repository contains a simple pseudocode algorithm that reads a sentence character by character and calculates:

- The length of the sentence (number of characters including the period)
- The number of words in the sentence (assuming words are separated by a single space)
- The number of vowels in the sentence (case-insensitive)

## Constraints

- The sentence must end with a period (.)
- Only *three counter variables* are used:
  - counter1 for sentence length
  - counter2 for word count
  - counter3 for vowel count

## Usage

This algorithm is meant for educational purposes, demonstrating character-by-character analysis using control structures and counters in a pseudocode-like format.
